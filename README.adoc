This guide walks you through the process of creating a Spring application connected with a MySQL Database.

== What you'll build

You'll create a MySQL database, build a Spring application and connect it with the newly created database.

NOTE: MySQL is GPL'd, so ANY PROGRAM USING IT MUST BE GPL'd too. Refer to the link:http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html[General Public Licence]

== What you'll need

* MySQL version 5.6

:java_version: 1.8

== Create the database

Go to the terminal (Command Prompt (cmd) in Microsoft Windows). Open MySQL Client with a user that can create new users.

For example: On a Linux, use the command

[source, sh]
----
$ sudo mysql --password
----

NOTE: This connects to MySQL as a root, this is NOT THE RECOMMENDED WAY.

Create a new database

[source, mysql]
----
mysql> create database db_example; -- Create the new database
mysql> create user 'springuser'@'localhost' identified by 'ThePassword'; -- Creates the user
mysql> grant all on db_example.* to 'springuser'@'localhost'; -- Gives all the privileges to the new user on the newly created database
----

== Create the Spring Application

Add `pom.xml` dependencies

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
<!-- JPA Data (We are going to use Repositories, Entities, Hibernate, etc...) -->

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>

<!-- Use MySQL Connector-J -->

<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.40</version>
</dependency>
----

or in Gradle `build.gradle`:

[source, groovy]
----
// JPA Data (We are going to use Repositories, Entities, Hibernate, etc...)
compile group: 'org.springframework.boot', name: 'spring-boot-starter-data-jpa'

// Use MySQL Connector-J
compile group: 'mysql', name: 'mysql-connector-java', version: '5.1.40'
----

Spring Boot gives you defaults on all things, the default in database is `H2`, so when you want to change this and use any other database you must define the connection attributes in the `application.properties` file

== Create the `application.properties` file

In the sources folder, you create a resource file `src/main/resources/application.properties`

[source, java]
----
include::complete/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

Here, `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` can be `none`, `update`, `create`, `create-drop`, refer to the Hibernate documentation for details.

* `none` This is the default for `MySQL`, no change to the database structure.
* `update` Hibernate changes the database according to the given Entity structures.
* `create` Creates the database every time, but don't drop it when close.
* `create-drop` Creates the database then drops it when the `SessionFactory` closes.

We here begin with `create` because we don't have the database structure yet. After the first run, we could switch it to `update` or `none` according to program requirements. Use `update` when you want to make some change to the database structure.

The default for `H2` and other embedded databases is `create-drop`, but for others like `MySQL` is `none`

It is good security practice that after your database is in production state, you make this `none` and revoke all privileges from the MySQL user connected to the Spring application, then give him only SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE.

This is coming in details in the end of this guide.

== Create the `@Entity` model

`src/main/java/hello/User.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/User.java[]
----

This is the entity class which Hibernate will automatically translate into a table

== Create the repository

`src/main/java/hello/UserRepository.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/UserRepository.java[]
----

This is the repository interface, this will be automatically implemented by Spring in a bean with the same name with changing case
The bean name will be `userRepository`

== Create a new controller for your Spring application

`src/main/java/hello/MainController.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/MainController.java[]
----

NOTE: The above example does not specify `GET` vs. `PUT`, `POST`, and so forth, because `@RequestMapping` maps all HTTP operations by default. Use `@RequestMapping(method=GET)` to narrow this mapping.


== Make the application executable

Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional link:/understanding/WAR[WAR] file for deployment to an external application server, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method. Along the way, you use Spring's support for embedding the link:/understanding/Tomcat[Tomcat] servlet container as the HTTP runtime, instead of deploying to an external instance.


`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_subhead.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]


Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.


== Test the application

Now that the application is running, you can test it.

Use `curl` for example.
Now you have 2 REST Web Services you can test

`localhost:8080/demo/getAll` This gets all data
`localhost:8080/demo/add` This adds one user to the data

[source,sh]
----
$ curl 'localhost:8080/demo/add?name=First&email=someemail@someemailprovider.com'
----

The reply should be

[source,sh]
----
Saved
----

[source,sh]
----
$ curl 'localhost:8080/demo/getAll'
----

The reply should be

[source,json]
----
[{"id":1,"name":"First","email":"someemail@someemailprovider.com"}]
----

== Make some security changes

Now when you are on production environment, you may be exposed to SQL injection attacks. A hacker may inject `DROP TABLE` or any other destructive SQL commands. So as a security practice, make those changes to your database first

[source,sh]
----
mysql> revoke all on db_example.* from 'springuser'@'localhost';
----

This revokes ALL the priviliges from the user associated with the Spring application. Now the Spring application CAN'T DO anything in the database. We don't want that, so

[source,sh]
----
mysql> grant select, insert, delete, update on db_example.* to 'springuser'@'localhost';
----

This gives your Spring application only the privileges necessary to make changes to ONLY the DATA of the database and not the STRUCTURE

Now make this change to your `src/main/resources/application.properties`

[source,java]
----
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
----

This is instead of `create` which was on the first run for Hibernate to create the tables from your Entities.

When you want to make changes on the database, regive the permissions, change the
`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` to `update`, then re-run your applications, then repeat.

== Summary

Congratulations! You've just developed a Spring application which is bound to a MySQL database, Ready for production!!!
