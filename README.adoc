This guide walks you through the process of creating a simple REST API application with resources that are protected by Spring Security's STATELESS session creation policy.

== What you'll build

You'll build a Spring REST API application that secures the API services with pre authenticated access token backed by a fixed list of users.

== Create an unsecured REST application

Before you can apply security to a web application, you need a web application to secure. The steps in this section walk you through creating a very simple web application. Then you secure it with Spring Security in the next section.

The web application includes two simple REST services: one saying hello to the world without security and the other one saying hello to the current user with security enabled. 

In Spring's approach to building RESTful web services, HTTP requests are handled by a controller. These components are easily identified by the http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{spring_version}/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RestController.html[`@RestController`] annotation, and the `RestApiController` below handles `GET` requests for `/api/secured` and `/api/unsecured` by returning a hello message:

`src/main/java/hello/RestApiController.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/RestApiController.java[]
----

At this point, you could jump ahead to _<<run_the_app>>_ and run the application without having to login to anything.

With the base simple web application created, you can add security to it.


[[initial]]
== Set up Spring Security

Suppose that you want to prevent unauthorized users from acessing the greeting service at "/api/secured". As it is now, if users call both api services, they see the greeting with no barriers to stop them. You need to add a barrier that forces the user to sign in before accessing the secured api service.

You do that by configuring Spring Security in the application. If Spring Security is on the classpath, the Spring Boot {SpringBootSecurity}[automatically secures all HTTP endpoints] with "basic" authenticaiton. But you can further customize the security settings. The first thing you need to do is add Spring Security to the classpath. 

With Gradle this would be one line in the `dependencies` closure:

`build.gradle`
[source,java]
----
dependencies {
    ...
include::complete/build.gradle[tag=security]
    ...
}
----

With Maven this would be an extra entry added to `<dependencies>`:

`pom.xml`
[source,zml]
----
<dependencies>
    ...
include::complete/pom.xml[tag=security]
    ...
</dependencies>
----

Here's a security configuration that ensures that only authenticated users can see the secret greeting:

`src/main/java/hello/security/ApiSecurityConfig.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/security/ApiSecurityConfig.java[]
----

The `ApiSecurityConfig` class is annotated with `@EnableWebSecurity` to enable Spring Security's web security support and provide the Spring  integration. It also extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` and overrides a couple of its methods to set some specifics of the web security configuration.

The `configure(HttpSecurity)` method defines which URL paths should be secured and which should not. Specifically, the "/api/unsecured" and "/authenticate" paths are configured to not require any authentication. All other paths must be authenticated and the authenticated users must have a  `USER` role.

When a valid authentication request is received at path `/authenticate`, an access token will be returned to the client as HTTP response header `X-Auth-Token`. This token can be used in subsequent api calls.
 
As for the `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder)` method, it sets up an in-memory user store with two users. The first user is given a username of "user", a password of "password", and a role of "USER". The second user is given a username of "foo", a password of "bee", and a role of "GUEST".

"ApiAuthenticationSuccessHandler.java" is where the access token is generated, put in a simple cache and returned to client after a sucessful authentication:

`src/main/java/hello/security/ApiAuthenticationSuccessHandler.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/security/ApiAuthenticationSuccessHandler.java[]
----

"ApiRequestHeaderAuthenticationFilter.java" is where the "X-Auth-Token" is checked and extracted from HTTP Request :

`src/main/java/hello/security/ApiRequestHeaderAuthenticationFilter.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/security/ApiRequestHeaderAuthenticationFilter.java[]
----

"ApiPreAuthUserDetailsService.java" is where the access token is checked whether it was a previously authenticated or not and if it is a valid token, then User details are loaded from cache :

`src/main/java/hello/security/ApiPreAuthUserDetailsService.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/security/ApiPreAuthUserDetailsService.java[]
----

"ApiPreAuthenticatedTokenCacheService.java" is a very simple in memory Spring Cache service for storing and querying the access tokens together with User details :

`src/main/java/hello/security/ApiPreAuthenticatedTokenCacheService.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/security/ApiPreAuthenticatedTokenCacheService.java[]

[[run_the_app]]
== Make the application executable

Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional _web application archive_ or link:/understanding/WAR[WAR] file for deployment to an external application server, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a _standalone application_. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method. And along the way, you use Spring's support for embedding the link:/understanding/Tomcat[Tomcat] servlet container as the HTTP runtime, instead of deploying to an external instance.


`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

The `main()` method defers to the http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring_boot_version}/api/org/springframework/boot/SpringApplication.html[`SpringApplication`] helper class, providing `Application.class` as an argument to its `run()` method. This tells Spring to read the annotation metadata from `Application` and to manage it as a component in the link:/understanding/application-context[Spring application context].

The `@ComponentScan` annotation tells Spring to search recursively through the `hello` package and its children for classes marked directly or indirectly with Spring's http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{spring_version}/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Component.html[`@Component`] annotation. This directive ensures that Spring finds and registers the `GreetingController`, because it is marked with `@RestController`, which in turn is a kind of `@Component` annotation.

The http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring_boot_version}/api/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/EnableAutoConfiguration.html[`@EnableAutoConfiguration`] annotation switches on reasonable default behaviors based on the content of your classpath. For example, because the application depends on the embeddable version of Tomcat (tomcat-embed-core.jar), a Tomcat server is set up and configured with reasonable defaults on your behalf. And because the application also depends on Spring MVC (spring-webmvc.jar), a Spring MVC http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{spring_version}/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/DispatcherServlet.html[`DispatcherServlet`] is configured and registered for you â€” no `web.xml` necessary! Auto-configuration is a powerful, flexible mechanism. See the http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring_boot_version}/api/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/EnableAutoConfiguration.html[API documentation] for further details.

Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.


== Test the service

Now that the service is up, visit http://localhost:8080/api/unsecured, where you see:

[source,json]
----
Hello world from UNSECURED REST service
----

If you try to access the secured service without a valid access token, you should see "HTTP-403 Forbidden" error message. 

In order to access the secured REST service, you need a REST client application or "curl" for adding Request Header values.
   
First, authenticate the user with http://localhost:8080/authenticate?username=user&password=password. The service will return a special HTTP response header `X-Auth-Token`. Copy the value of this header for using in the next step.

Next, call the secured REST service with HTTP request header `X-Auth-Token` with the value obtained in previous step. `curl --header "X-Auth-Token: a5938b2e-42bd-43aa-8b9c-97a4cf9e9361" http://localhost:8080/api/secured`, where you see:

[source,json]
----
Hello [user] from SECURED REST service
----

If you try with user "foo", you can still authenticate and get a valid access token. However, when you try to reach the secured service with token generated for user "foo", you will get a nice "HTTP-403 Forbidden" error message because the user "foo" does not have "USER" role, insted it has "GUEST" role.  


== Summary
Congratulations! You have developed a simple RESTful api application that is secured with Spring Security.
